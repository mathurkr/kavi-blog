# Kavi's Blog
This is meant to be a replacement for my current portfolio website, but I'm just treating it as a side project to learn the basics of Svelte, typescript, tailwindcss, etc.

## TO-DO
- Create /blog and a sample page

## Sources
**This blog format is heavily based on the following tutorial by Raphael Megzari. I plan to change the format (metadata, styling for markdown, etc) as I make the blog custom to myself**
